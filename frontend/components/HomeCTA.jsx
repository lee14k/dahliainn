            The Blue Mystique Inn is a beautiful, 5-bedroom historic bed & breakfast in
            downtown Manistique - the heart of the Upper Peninsula. Built in the
            early 1900's, the recently renovated bed & breakfast is central to many of the
            UP's attractions - including Big Springs and Pictured Rocks - and
            just steps away from parks, trails, dining, shopping, and nightlife,
            After you're done hiking, biking, swimming, waterfall hunting, fall
            color touring, or enjoying snow sports, relax and make yourself at home at this wonderful bed and breakfast
